Hi there! I’m currently enrolled at Mahoning County Career & Technical Center, where I'm diving deep into Software Engineering & Development. I love exploring new technologies and frameworks, always looking to expand my skill set and tackle new challenges.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar or skating—both passions that keep me creative and active.
