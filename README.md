Hi there! I’m a former student at Mahoning County Career & Technical Center, where I was diving deep into Software Engineering & Development. I love exploring new technologies and frameworks, always looking to expand my skill set and tackle new challenges.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar, a passion that keeps me creative and active.
